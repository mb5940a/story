		<h2> "Piles of Concrete" </h2>
		<p>Brutalism has some severe critics, including Charles, Prince of Wales, whose speeches and writings on architecture have excoriated Brutalism, calling many of the structures "piles of concrete". A 2014 article in The Economist noted its unpopularity with the public, observing that a campaign to demolish a building will usually be directed against a Brutalist one. In 2005, the British TV program Demolition ran a public vote to select 12 buildings that ought to be demolished, and 8 of those selected were Brutalist buildings. The Queen Elizabeth Square flats (pictured above) in Glasgow were demolished in 1993. <br><br>One argument is that this criticism exists in part because concrete façades do not age well in damp, cloudy maritime climates such as those of northwestern Europe and New England. In these climates, the concrete becomes streaked with water stains and sometimes with moss and lichens, and rust stains from the steel reinforcing bars. </p>

	<h2> "Cold" Appearance</h2>
	<p>Critics of the style find it unappealing due to its "cold" appearance, projecting an atmosphere of totalitarianism, as well as the association of the buildings with urban decay due to materials weathering poorly in certain climates and the surfaces being prone to vandalism by graffiti. Despite this, the style is appreciated by others, and preservation efforts are taking place in the United Kingdom.</p>

	<h2> Distaste from Oregon </h2>
	<p>At the University of Oregon campus, outrage and vocal distaste for Brutalism led, in part, to the hiring of Christopher Alexander and the initiation of The Oregon Experiment in the late 1970s. This led to the development of Alexander's A Pattern Language and The Timeless Way of Building. Park Hill in 2013 (pictured) was a brutalist building that experienced substantial refurbishment due to criticism.

<div class="p4">
	<h2> "Moral Deformity" </h2>
<p>Anthony Daniels, a British author, physician, and political commentator, has written for City Journal that Brutalist structures represent an artefact of European philosophical totalitarianism, a "spiritual, intellectual, and moral deformity." He called the buildings "cold-hearted", "inhuman", "hideous", and "monstrous". He stated that the reinforced concrete "does not age gracefully but instead crumbles, stains, and decays", which makes alternative building styles superior. Tesco Shopping Centre (pictured) (1962) in Košice, Slovakia, is one of the first and strongly criticised Brutalist buildings in the former Czechoslovakia. It was previously known as Obchodný dom Prior.
